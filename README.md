# Transformer PyTorch Implementation

## Introduction

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, a state-of-the-art architecture in natural language processing and machine translation. The Transformer model has gained significant popularity due to its parallelization capabilities and superior performance.

## Key Features

- **Encoder and Decoder Architecture**: The repository includes modules for both encoder and decoder layers, featuring self-attention mechanisms.

- **Tokenization**: A tokenization module is provided for preprocessing input text data, enabling efficient embedding and model input preparation.

- **Training and Evaluation**: The repository provides scripts for training the Transformer model on custom datasets, along with evaluation scripts to assess model performance using standard metrics.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Prepare Data**: Preprocess and organize the data required for training and evaluation tasks.

3. **Train the Model**: Use the provided training scripts to train the Transformer model on your dataset:

    ```
    python train.py
    ```

4. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the evaluation scripts:

    ```
    None
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch
- Additional dependencies specified in requirements.txt
